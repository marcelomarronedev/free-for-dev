## Changelog

-   **2025-11-20** -- Project renamed from AGGHOME to FEEDSHOME, generalizing its purpose and adding new functionalities
    (language--topic--country categorization, feed submissions).
-   **2025-11-11** -- Added voting functionality for aggregators (requires backend). One vote per IP.
-   **2025-11-06** -- Added commenting for each aggregator using [utteranc.es](https://utteranc.es).
-   **2025-11-06** -- Added news sharing via the Web Share API.
-   **2025-11-05** -- Added news history for each feed. Since there is no backend, the history is stored in the browser's localStorage:
    only news that appeared while the application was open will be     shown.
-   **2025-11-04** -- Initial version.

## Usage

1.  Clone the repository:

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/enterum/aggrhome.git
cd aggrhome
```

2.  Install dependencies:

``` bash
npm install
```

3.  Compile TypeScript:

``` bash
npm run build
```

## Adding New Feeds Manually (in your own fork)

RSS feeds are managed through the `feeds.txt` file located at the root of the project.
Each line contains, separated by commas:

-   feed name
-   feed URL
-   default image URL
-   feed type: `rss` or `atom`
-   whether the image is included in the description tag (`true`/`false`)
-   category code
-   country code
-   language code

Example:

```
    Menéame,https://www.meneame.net/rss,https://enterum.github.io/aggrhome/img/meneame.png,rss,true,AGR,ES,es
    KillBait,https://killbaitnews.github.io/rssfeeds/en.rss,https://enterum.github.io/aggrhome/img/killbait.png,rss,false,AGR,ES,en
    El País,https://feeds.elpais.com/mrss-s/pages/ep/site/elpais.com/section/ultimas-noticias/portada,https://static.elpais.com/dist/resources/images/logos/primary/el-pais.svg,rss,false,PON,ES,es
```
